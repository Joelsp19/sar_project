## situation_summary
Three hiking groups (8 people) are missing in Mount Baker Wilderness after a sudden storm. Environmental conditions are hazardous, with low temperatures, high winds, limited visibility, and light rain. Cell signals indicate three possible locations.
## primary_risks
- Hypothermia
- Navigation difficulties due to low visibility
- Injuries from falls or exposure
- Delayed response due to terrain and weather
- Communication difficulties

# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Prioritize searching sectors where cell signals were last detected. Implement a hasty search strategy to cover the most probable areas quickly, followed by a more detailed grid search if necessary. Coordinate search efforts closely with available SAR teams.
## resource_allocation
Divide search teams to cover the three sectors with cell signals. Deploy the rescue team to the sector with the highest probability of finding injured individuals. The medical team should be on standby near the incident command post, ready for immediate deployment.
## priority_areas
- Sector 1 (Cell Signal 1)
- Sector 2 (Cell Signal 2)
- Sector 3 (Cell Signal 3)
## timeline
Phase 1 (Initial Hasty Search): 6 hours. Phase 2 (Detailed Grid Search, if needed): 12-18 hours. Continuous monitoring of weather conditions.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
Monitor weather forecasts continuously. If conditions worsen (heavy snow, increased winds), recall search teams to staging area. Prepare for potential overnight stay in the field if extraction becomes impossible.
## medical_emergency
Establish clear medical evacuation procedures. Identify landing zones for helicopter extraction if necessary. Designate back-up personnel for medical support.
## communications_failure
Utilize satellite phones as backup communication. Establish visual signals and pre-arranged meeting points.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on probability of success. Request additional resources from neighboring SAR teams if needed. Implement rationing of supplies if necessary.
