## situation_summary
Three hiking groups are missing in Mount Baker Wilderness after a sudden storm. Low temperatures, high winds, and limited visibility pose significant risks to the missing persons and search teams. Last known cell signals originate from three different sectors.
## primary_risks
- Hypothermia
-  disorientation due to low visibility
- Injuries from falls on icy terrain
- Communication challenges due to weather and terrain

# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Implement a sector-based search based on the last known cell tower signals. Prioritize areas with higher probability of hikers seeking shelter. Utilize FPS devices to aid in navigation and tracking in low visibility. All teams follow buddy-system protocols.
## resource_allocation
Allocate search teams to sectors based on signal strength and terrain difficulty. Position the rescue team to be mobile and ready for rapid extraction. Medical team should be staged near the incident command post for immediate response and transport.
## priority_areas
- Sector 1 (Strongest Cell Signal)
- Sector 2
- Sector 3
## timeline
Phase 1 (First 12 hours): Intensive search and rescue efforts in priority sectors. Phase 2 (12-24 hours): Expand search area and reassess based on findings. Continuous medical support and re-evaluation every 6 hours.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
If weather conditions worsen (increased precipitation, reduced visibility), suspend search operations and relocate teams to safe staging areas. Reassess the situation and adjust search strategy accordingly.
## medical_emergency
Establish a clear medical evacuation plan. Identify landing zones for helicopter transport. Train all team members in basic first aid and emergency procedures.
## communications_failure
Utilize backup communication methods, such as satellite phones or signal flares. Establish pre-determined rendezvous points for teams in case of communication loss.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on probability of success. Request additional resources from neighboring agencies if needed. Ration supplies and equipment to ensure availability for critical tasks.
