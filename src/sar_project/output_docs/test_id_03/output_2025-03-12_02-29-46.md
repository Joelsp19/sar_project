## situation_summary
Five climbers are missing in Mount Hood National Forest following an avalanche. Weather conditions are poor with low temperatures, strong winds, limited visibility, and snow. Cell signals from two sectors indicate possible locations of the missing climbers. Time is critical due to hypothermia risk.
## primary_risks
- Hypothermia
- Further Avalanches
- Limited Visibility
- Difficult Terrain
- Communication Issues

# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Prioritize sectors with last cell signals. Utilize a hasty search approach with two-person teams initially, focusing on areas most likely to provide shelter. Follow up with more detailed grid searches. Ensure all teams have avalanche beacons and probe poles.
## resource_allocation
Allocate two search teams to each sector identified by cell signals. Stage the rescue teams and medical team near the Incident Command Post for rapid deployment. Ensure each team has adequate communication equipment and cold-weather gear.
## priority_areas
- Sector 1 - Last cell signal
- Sector 2 - Last cell signal
- Areas prone to snowdrifts and natural shelters
## timeline
Phase 1 (First 12 hours): Hasty search in priority sectors. Phase 2 (Next 12 hours): Detailed grid search. Phase 3 (Following 24 hours): Broadened search area based on findings.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
If weather worsens (heavy snowfall, increased winds, further reduced visibility), suspend search operations and prioritize team safety. Move teams to safe locations and reassess situation. Consider using snowmobiles for transport if conditions allow.
## medical_emergency
Initiate immediate medical evacuation. Contact air support if available. Designate landing zone. Provide initial treatment and stabilization until transport arrives.
## communications_failure
Utilize backup communication methods (satellite phones, signal flares). Establish pre-determined rendezvous points. Relay information through runners if necessary.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on probability of success. Request additional resources from neighboring SAR teams. Ration supplies and equipment carefully.
