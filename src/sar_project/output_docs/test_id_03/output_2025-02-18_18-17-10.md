## situation_summary
5 climbers are missing in Mount Hood National Forest after an avalanche. Environmental conditions are challenging, including low temperatures, high winds, low visibility, and snowfall.
## primary_risks
- Further avalanches
- Hypothermia and frostbite for missing climbers and search teams
- Navigation difficulties due to low visibility
- Communication breakdowns due to weather
- Injuries during search and rescue operations

# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Utilize sector-based search approach based on cell tower pings. Prioritize areas with higher probability of finding the missing climbers based on avalanche path and potential shelter locations. Establish a command post for coordination.
## resource_allocation
Assign 2 search teams to the sectors with cell tower signals. Assign 1 search team to the area above the last known location. Staging rescue and medical teams near the command post for quick deployment. Rotate search and rescue teams to prevent hypothermia. 
## priority_areas
- Sector 1: Cell tower signal area
- Sector 2: Cell tower signal area
- Avalanche path area
- Potential natural shelters (caves, rock overhangs)
## timeline
Phase 1 (0-6 hours): Immediate search of cell tower sectors. Phase 2 (6-12 hours): Expand search area based on Phase 1 findings. Phase 3 (12-24 hours): Continued search and re-evaluation of strategy.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
If weather worsens (e.g., visibility drops below 0.25 miles, wind speeds exceed 30 mph), suspend search operations and recall all teams to the command post. Re-evaluate the situation and adjust strategy accordingly.
## medical_emergency
Establish clear medical evacuation procedures. Designate landing zones for helicopter evacuation if necessary. Maintain communication with air support. Have an alternative route in case air support is unavailable.
## communications_failure
Utilize backup communication methods (satellite phones, signal flares). Establish pre-determined rendezvous points in case of communication loss. Implement a runner system for critical information.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on probability of success. Request additional resources (personnel, equipment) from neighboring jurisdictions if needed. Implement a rationing system for emergency supplies.
