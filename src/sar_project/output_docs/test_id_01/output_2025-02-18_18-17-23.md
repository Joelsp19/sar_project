# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Conduct a hasty search along the Green Hollow Trail, focusing on the area between the 6-mile mark and the summit. Prioritize areas with potential hazards such as steep slopes and dense vegetation. Utilize a grid search pattern in areas of uncertainty. Deploy teams to sweep known overlooks and water sources.
## resource_allocation
Allocate Team Alpha to start at the trailhead and move up the trail. Allocate Team Bravo to start at the 6-mile mark and move towards the summit. Allocate Team Charlie to sweep the area around the summit. Position Team Echo and Delta at the trailhead for initial medical assessment and potential extraction.
## priority_areas
- Area between 6-mile mark and summit
- Summit area
- Steep slopes and dense vegetation along the trail
- Water sources
## timeline
Initiate search operations immediately. Aim to reach the summit area within 4 hours. Re-evaluate strategy and resource allocation by 12:00 AM based on initial findings.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
If weather worsens (heavy rain, strong winds), teams should seek shelter and adjust search patterns to focus on areas with natural protection. Consider suspending the search if conditions become too dangerous.
## medical_emergency
If a medical emergency occurs, stabilize the patient, request immediate medical assistance via radio, and prepare for extraction. Team Delta will provide medical guidance remotely.
## communications_failure
If radio communications fail, use pre-determined hand signals and move to higher ground to attempt re-establishing contact. If communication remains impossible, follow pre-arranged fallback routes.
## resource_limitations
If resources become limited, prioritize search areas based on probability of success and potential for survival. Request additional resources from mutual aid partners if needed.
