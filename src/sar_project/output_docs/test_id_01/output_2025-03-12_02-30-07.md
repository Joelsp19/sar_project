# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Systematic search of accessible hiking trails and roads, prioritizing areas near water sources. Focus on likely travel routes and known viewpoints. Utilize a grid search pattern where appropriate. Leverage local knowledge of the terrain.
## resource_allocation
Allocate available search teams based on terrain accessibility, assigning rescue teams to potentially hazardous areas. Medical teams should be strategically positioned for rapid response.
## priority_areas
- Main hiking trails
- Areas near water sources
- Known viewpoints
- Areas with cell phone reception
## timeline
Phase 1: Immediate search of high-probability areas (4 hours). Phase 2: Expanded search of remaining areas (8 hours). Continuous reassessment based on weather and new information.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
If weather worsens (e.g., increased rain, stronger winds), suspend search and rescue operations. Move teams to safe locations. Reassess situation when weather improves. Implement buddy system and monitor for signs of hypothermia.
## medical_emergency
Designate a medical evacuation point. Establish communication protocols with local emergency services. Ensure all teams have basic first aid training. Helicopter extraction if weather permits, otherwise ground transport.
## communications_failure
Implement backup communication methods (satellite phones, signal flares). Establish pre-determined rendezvous points. Use visual signals if necessary.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on probability of success. Request additional resources from neighboring jurisdictions. Conserve equipment and supplies.
