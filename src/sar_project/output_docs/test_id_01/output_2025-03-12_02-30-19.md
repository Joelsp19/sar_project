# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Resume search at first light, focusing on accessible trails and prioritizing areas identified by last known location. Utilize a grid search pattern in high-probability zones. Incorporate air support if available and weather permits. Maintain constant communication with teams.
## resource_allocation
Allocate search teams to cover the open hiking trails near False. Ensure each team has a medical personnel. Keep rescue team on standby for immediate response. Distribute equipment, prioritizing thermal imaging and communication devices.
## priority_areas
- Open hiking trails
- Roads near hiking trails
- <identified last known location>
## timeline
Operation to commence at first light and continue until dusk, reassess at 6:00 PM. Evaluate the need for night search based on findings.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
Monitor weather conditions continuously. If heavy rain or strong winds return, suspend search operations and regroup teams at a designated safe location.
## medical_emergency
Establish clear communication protocols for reporting medical emergencies. Designate a landing zone for helicopter evacuation if needed. Ensure all teams are trained in basic first aid and CPR.
## communications_failure
Utilize backup communication methods, such as satellite phones or manual signaling, if radio communication fails. Establish pre-arranged rendezvous points for teams to report in person.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on likelihood of success. Request additional resources from neighboring agencies if necessary. Implement a system for tracking and managing supplies.
