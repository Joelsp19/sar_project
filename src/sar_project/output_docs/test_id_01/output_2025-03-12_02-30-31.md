## primary_risks
- Hypothermia for search teams and missing persons
- Reduced visibility impacting search effectiveness
- Slippery trail conditions increasing risk of falls
- Delayed response due to difficult terrain and weather

# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Conduct a systematic grid search of the designated area near the summit, focusing on areas where a lost person may seek shelter. Prioritize trails and known landmarks.
## resource_allocation
Allocate available search teams to the upper section of the trail. Stage rescue and medical teams at a lower, accessible location for quick extraction if needed.
## priority_areas
- Upper trail sections
- Areas near known landmarks and viewpoints
- Potential shelter locations (e.g., caves, overhanging rocks)
- <>
## timeline
Initial intensive search for 12 hours, reassess based on findings and weather conditions.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
If weather worsens (heavy rain, increased fog, temperature drop), suspend search operations and move teams to a safe location. Reassess the situation when weather improves.
## medical_emergency
In case of a medical emergency, stabilize the patient and immediately contact Rescue-1. Coordinate helicopter evacuation if necessary.
## communications_failure
Use pre-designated backup communication frequencies. Establish a runner system to relay messages between teams if radio communication fails.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on probability of success. Request additional resources from neighboring agencies if available. Implement search fatigue management protocols.
