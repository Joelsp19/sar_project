## notes
Search resumed with improved but still challenging weather conditions (38°F, light rain, fog). Teams are now focusing on the upper section of the trail near the summit. Remind teams of the potential for hypothermia due to cold and wet conditions.
# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Continue search operations focusing on the upper section of the trail near the summit. Adjust search patterns to account for reduced visibility due to fog. Reiterate the importance of shelter identification and hypothermia prevention.
## resource_allocation
Maintain Team Delta and Team Echo at the trailhead for immediate medical assessment and extraction. Teams Alpha, Bravo and Charlie will focus on the upper section of the trail, adjusting their search patterns as needed due to fog. Consider deploying additional thermal imaging equipment to aid in the search given the fog.
## priority_areas
- Upper section of the trail near the summit
- Potential shelter locations in the summit area
- Steep slopes and dense vegetation (proceed with extreme caution)
## timeline
Re-evaluate strategy and resource allocation every hour based on evolving weather conditions and search progress. Focus efforts on high probability areas given the time elapsed since the subjects were last seen.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
Continue to monitor weather conditions closely, particularly fog and rain. If weather worsens (heavy rain, strong winds, below freezing temperatures), consider adjusting search patterns to ensure team safety. Implement mandatory rest periods and temperature checks for all teams.
## medical_emergency
Continue to emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment of hypothermia. Ensure all teams have adequate supplies for warming and fluid resuscitation. Team Delta will provide medical guidance remotely.
## communications_failure
Reinforce the use of pre-determined hand signals and fallback routes. Consider deploying a communications relay team to improve radio coverage in the area, especially given potential signal blockage due to terrain and fog.
## resource_limitations
Re-evaluate resource allocation based on the evolving situation. Request additional resources from mutual aid partners if needed, particularly cold weather gear and personnel trained in hypothermia management.
