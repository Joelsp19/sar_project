## location
Green Hollow Trail, Blue Ridge Mountains
## description
Weather has deteriorated with heavy rain and strong winds. Temperature has dropped to 45Â°F. Continued search operation for Alice Turner, Ben Jackson, and Carlos Mendoza.
## status
Active
## teams_involved
- TEAM-ALPHA
- TEAM-BRAVO
- TEAM-CHARLIE
- TEAM-DELTA
- TEAM-ECHO
## resources_used
- Radios
- GPS Devices
- First Aid Kits
- Emergency Supplies
- Rope Rescue Equipment
- Extraction Equipment
- Medical Evacuation Equipment
## notes
Weather conditions have significantly worsened, increasing the risk of hypothermia. Re-evaluate search strategy due to reduced visibility and increased hazards. Consider deploying a cold weather gear resupply to the teams currently deployed.
# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Due to deteriorating weather, shift search focus to areas offering natural shelter. Re-evaluate search patterns to prioritize survival. Implement contingency plans for weather deterioration and potential hypothermia cases.
## resource_allocation
Maintain Team Delta and Team Echo at the trailhead for immediate medical assessment and extraction. Team Alpha, Bravo and Charlie should adjust search patterns to minimize exposure to the elements. Re-evaluate if search teams need to be pulled back to trailhead.
## priority_areas
- Areas with natural protection along the trail
- Summit area (with adjusted search pattern)
- Steep slopes and dense vegetation (proceed with extreme caution)
## timeline
Re-evaluate strategy and resource allocation every hour based on evolving weather conditions. Prepare for potential suspension of search if weather becomes too dangerous. A decision on whether to keep teams deployed will be made at 21:30.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
Continue to monitor weather conditions closely. If weather worsens further (heavy rain, strong winds, below freezing temperatures), consider suspending the search and prioritizing the safety of search teams. Implement mandatory rest periods and temperature checks for all teams.
## medical_emergency
Continue to emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment of hypothermia. Ensure all teams have adequate supplies for warming and fluid resuscitation. Team Delta will provide medical guidance remotely.
## communications_failure
Reinforce the use of pre-determined hand signals and fallback routes. Consider deploying a communications relay team to improve radio coverage in the area.
## resource_limitations
Re-evaluate resource allocation based on the evolving situation. Request additional resources from mutual aid partners if needed, particularly cold weather gear and personnel trained in hypothermia management.
