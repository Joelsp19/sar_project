# analysis
## severity_level
HIGH
## situation_summary
Two campers are missing in Yosemite National Park after a flash flood. Last known location identified via cell tower signals. Current conditions are favorable, but the initial event poses significant risks.
## primary_risks
- Injuries sustained during the flash flood
- Hypothermia (especially overnight)
- Entrapment in debris or hazardous terrain
- Communication failure
- Search area inaccuracy

# strategic_decisions
## search_strategy
Utilize a grid search pattern radiating outward from the last known location. Prioritize areas downstream from the flash flood zone and areas with potential for entrapment (e.g., caves, dense vegetation). Leverage cell tower data to refine the search area. Employ a combination of ground and aerial search teams.
## resource_allocation
Allocate primary search teams to the area surrounding the last known location, supplemented by additional search teams to cover the surrounding area. Rescue team to prepare for possible evacuation. The medical team should be staged near the incident command post and prepared for immediate deployment. Prioritize immediate coverage of areas identified as high risk based on flood path analysis.
## priority_areas
- Downstream from last known location
- Areas with dense vegetation
- Caves and rocky outcrops
- Steep terrain prone to landslides
- Areas identified through cell tower triangulation
## timeline
Initiate search operations immediately. Establish a 24-hour operational period, with reassessment and adjustments every 6 hours. Aim for initial contact within 12 hours.
# contingency_plans
## weather_deterioration
Monitor weather forecasts closely. If weather worsens (e.g., increased rainfall, reduced visibility), suspend search operations and relocate teams to safe areas. Reassess the situation and adjust the search plan accordingly.
## medical_emergency
Establish a clear medical evacuation plan. Identify potential landing zones for helicopters if needed. Coordinate with local hospitals and emergency services. Ensure all teams are trained in basic first aid and CPR.
## communications_failure
Establish backup communication methods (e.g., satellite phones, hand signals). Designate communication relays if necessary. Ensure all teams have a clear understanding of communication protocols.
## resource_limitations
Prioritize search areas based on risk assessment. Request additional resources from neighboring jurisdictions if needed. Implement a resource management system to track and allocate resources effectively.
